Class News (ap.class.php)
I developed this class as part of the work I did for Cytak, Inc.
This class was used to parse a rss feed from the Asssociated Press which was a paid subscription the organization used to 
gather news data as part of its data mining process. In addition to parsing the rss feed, the class also had methods that could be used
for interacting with a web service (AlchemyAPI.com) in order to determine sentiment value of a particular piece of content.

Class Ar (apl_controller.php) and Class Request (apl_model.php)
These classes were part of an application that I took over and helped launch as part of my first 30 days with Apple, Inc.
The application was built using the Codeigniter framework.
Though I had inherited an application that was in the final QA stage, I was allowed to refine it and still meet the launch date.

manage_talent.js
This was one of the js scripts that I developed for Talentearth.com.
The application uses the JQuery framework. 

braintree.php
This script was developed for Alamo Capital (www.alamocapital.com) to assist their primary developer in creating an online payment option.
The script uses a php library from Braintree (www.braintree.com) to process the payments and store certain customer data.
A function to send simple email notifications to administrators was also included. 
Initially developed to demo a proof of concept, it was later used in a production ennvironment.

jfj_biblia_controller.php
Developed for Jews for Jesus
A short script used to retrieve the bible verse text from a web service.
Example page in production: 
http://www.jewsforjesus.org/how-to-know-god/who-is-god/who-is-god-interactive-study-guide
If a visitor clicks on the incorrect answer the controller is passed a bible scripture reference (ie. John 3:16) and this is used
to retrieve the accompanying text.
